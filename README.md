# Tilde

A minimal, keyboard-driven browser start page.

I got bored of default tab pages and the clutter that comes with most replacements. Tilde is what I wanted instead, a clean homepage that stays out of the way but makes it fast to get where I'm going.

It supports dual profiles (personal and work), each with their own set of quick-launch commands (shift+Q and shift+w) and a distinct background gradient so you always know which mode you're in. Search pulls suggestions from Google inline, and the whole thing is navigable without touching a mouse.

One HTML file, a couple of fonts, and that's it.
